{"name":"Mosca","tagline":"The MQTT server for node.js that can be backed up by AMQP, Redis, ZeroMQ or just MQTT. That's meta!","body":"Mosca\r\n=====\r\n\r\n[![Build\r\nStatus](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/mosca.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/mosca)\r\n\r\n__Mosca__ is a [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker that aim to be backed up\r\nby every publish/subscribe broker or protocol out there.\r\nThis list currently includes:\r\n\r\n* [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) and all implementations of\r\n  the [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/) protocol.\r\n* [Redis](http://redis.io/), the fabulous key/value store by\r\n  [@antirez](https://github.com/antirez).\r\n* [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) and all implementations of the\r\n  [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol.\r\n* [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/) without a central broker, so\r\n  Ascoltatori can also be used in a P2P fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Mosca__ is still under active development, but it should work :).\r\nLet me know if you plan to use __Mosca__ in production.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nMosca is a node.js application, so it needs [node.js](http://nodejs.org)\r\nto run.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$: npm install mosca -g\r\n$: mosca -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can connect to it with your preferred [MQTT](http://mqtt.org)\r\nclient.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* MQTT 3.0 compliant\r\n* QoS 0 only\r\n* Built on top on node.js\r\n* As fast as it is possible\r\n* Usable inside ANY other node.js app, see the\r\n  [API](http://mcollina.github.com/mosca/docs/server.js.html).\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nMosca supports some command line options:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: mosca [options]\r\n\r\n  Options:\r\n\r\n    -h, --help           output usage information\r\n    -V, --version        output the version number\r\n    -p, --port <n>       the port to listen to\r\n    --parent-port <n>    the parent port to connect to\r\n    --parent-host <s>    the parent host to connect to\r\n    --parent-prefix <s>  the prefix to use in the parent broker\r\n    -c, --config <c>     the config file to use (override every \r\n                         other options)\r\n    -v, --verbose        equal to DEBUG=mosca\r\n    --very-verbose       equal to DEBUG=mosca,ascoltatori:*\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever you can only use a MQTT backend with the command line options.\r\n\r\nIf you want to unleash the full power of mosca, you will need to\r\nuse a configuration file.\r\nSome examples are included in this repository, one using\r\n[Redis](https://github.com/mcollina/mosca/tree/master/examples/redis),\r\nand one using a\r\n[tree-based](https://github.com/mcollina/mosca/tree/master/examples/mosca-tree) topology of Moscas.\r\n\r\n## Contributing to Mosca\r\n\r\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been\r\n  implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet\r\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't\r\n  requested it and/or contributed it\r\n* Fork the project\r\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch\r\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution\r\n* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it\r\n  in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Please try not to mess with the Makefile and package.json. If you\r\n  want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is\r\n  fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n## LICENSE - \"MIT License\"\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Matteo Collina, http://matteocollina.com\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
